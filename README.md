# Discord Companion

Your companion is a customizable Discord AI Chatbot designed to provide a personalized, engaging, and humorous AI interaction experience. Whether you want a playful companion, a helpful assistant, or both, your companion is here for you!

## Features:
- **Conversational Integration**: Your companion interacts naturally and contextually with users on Discord.
- **Toolset**: Your companion has various tools at its disposal such as reading webpages, setting reminders, storing records for later retrieval, and more.
- **Memory Management**: Separate conversation threads with memory retention for a cohesive chatting experience.
- **Humor & Affection**: Your companion combines playful teasing with affectionate banter to keep conversations lively and engaging.

## Functions:
For now please refer to the tool_call directory for a look at all the functions available.

I plan to soon write a more comprehensive readme, until then all of the tools are described by the jsons in that folder :)
